<H1>Human factors project milestone 1</H1>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p> Human factors is something i have study regulary as a compliance requirement for being an aircraft maintenance engineer. Recently i moved industries and quickly saw scope for human factors training in other technical industries. "Human factors" refers to the study of human capabilities and limitations in the workplace. Human factors researchers study system performance. That is, they study the interaction of maintenance personnel, the equipment they use, the written and verbal procedures and rules they follow, and the environmental conditions of any system. The aim of human factors is to optimise the relationship between maintenance personnel and systems with a view to improving safety, efficiency and well-being”. </p>

<h2>Issues Encountered</h2>

<details>
<summary></summary>
<ul>
<li>Some difficulties with responsiveness but got there in the end i think. </li>
<li>I intended to learn how to add a google maps iframe and more information on the content page , but due to time constraints was unable to, this will be added in future.</li>
<li>I tried but was unable to add a pentagon shape in the center skills section to complement the image and the five surronding items, this will be added in future.</li>
<li>I tried but was unable to add an animation so the main image would slowly and constantly move from left to right, this will be added in future.</li>
<li>Wireframes was something i completely missed however i have made it a priority to be up to speed quickly and efficiently for the next project.</li>
